YouTube Jukebox lets you play YouTube tracks (single videos or whole playlists) inside Foundry VTT so that everyone hears the same thing. It also supports a second, optional “Overlay” track for ambience or SFX that can play at the same time as the main music. Libraries are saved in the world (GM-managed) so you don’t have to re-import every session.

Key Features
Main player: Play/pause/stop/seek, previous/next, auto-advance to the next track.

Overlay player (OL): Play a second track simultaneously (e.g., ambience + voiceover/SFX). Separate pause/stop and per-client overlay volume. No auto-advance (by design).

Saved library: GM can store tracks under Groups (playlists). Import single videos or entire playlists via URL.

Drag/move tracks between groups; remove individual tracks or delete whole groups.

Inline group rename: Double-click a group name to rename it.

Per-client volumes: Each player controls their own main and overlay volume via a hover popover attached to the music icon — doesn’t affect others.

Draggable music icon (FAB): Move the icon anywhere on screen; position is saved per client and the volume popover follows it.

Keybinding: Open/close the Jukebox with a hotkey (default Ctrl/Cmd + K) and change it from Foundry’s Keybindings UI.

Permissions: Choose who can control playback globally (GM only or everyone).

Optional YouTube API key: Fetches proper playlist/video titles. Without it, the module falls back to a public title lookup that may be slower or limited.
